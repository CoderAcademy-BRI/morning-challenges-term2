# For this challenge, your Todo List should be able to perform all actions
# given in the test. Namely you should be able to:
# 1. create a new todo list with a title and description
# 2. update the title or description
# 3. get a count of items in the list
# 4. check to see if all items in the list are marked done
# 5. mark all items in the list as done
# 6. add items to the list
# 7. mark a single item in the list as done
# 8. delete items from the list

# To accomplish this, you should define two classes - a TodoList class
# and a TodoListItem class.
